        "review" : "Another thing I am doing to see if I can boost the performance at all is getting a better MicroSD card. Dont get me wrong, the MicroSD card that ships with this kit is quite sufficient for almost everything and everyone, but I wanted a 64gb card so I went for a Sandisk Extreme Pro which is supposed to have some of the best performance in a Pi4(benchmarks available on Piâ€™s website). Hopefully this will make it just a bit faster.",

You were always forced to ssh into it from a real computer if you planned on having a few chrome tabs opened while working on a project. Me personally, I like having several tabs up trying to research how to do one thing or another and could never do that on pi 1-3.",

I contacted the vendor and they offered to send a replacement RPi4. Turns out that was unnecessary: I unplugged the case top with fan, and RPi4 booted to NOOBS install as it should. After install/update/restart I plugged in the case top/fan and all worked as vendor and other reviews said. Great device, great vendor support!",

I never knew what it was or even what it could do till I did some research on the raspberry pi 3 and I was so interested on what you could do so I was going to buy me one but never got around to it cause of issues and such but then I saw that the Raspberry Pi 4 came out. I took the plunge and got the complete kit so I would have everything needed to start it all off.",

I highly recommend getting a kit that has a case with fan, as the RaspberryPi 4 B runs hot because of its increased performance. The kit overall is great, anyone who has built a computer or RaspberryPi before will feel right at home and breeze through installation of the heatsinks, the chipset inside the case, and plugging the fan in.",

For the $69.99 price tag you really cant beat it, thats only a few dollars more then the standalone 2GB Raspberry Pi 4 B normally costs!",
